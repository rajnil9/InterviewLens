            <p><strong>Experience:</strong> My interview process at Google consisted of five rounds, beginning with an initial screening, followed by two technical interviews, a system design round, and a final behavioral interview. The initial screening assessed my background, skills, and overall fit for the role. The technical interviews focused heavily on data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving abilities, requiring me to efficiently write and optimize code under time constraints. In the system design round, I was asked to architect scalable and efficient solutions for real-world applications, demonstrating my ability to design complex systems. Finally, the behavioral interview evaluated my teamwork, communication, and problem-solving approach in collaborative settings. Overall, the process was rigorous but provided a great opportunity to showcase my technical expertise and problem-solving skills.</p>
